-- * Helper Functions

-- | Delete first occurrence of the character in a list.
delete :: Char -> String -> String
delete _ []     = []
delete x (y:ys) = if x == y
                    then ys
                    else y : delete x ys

-- | Check if a word contains only characters from a list.
isValid :: String -> String -> Bool
isValid _  []     = True
isValid [] _      = False
isValid (x:xs) ys = if x `elem` ys
                      then isValid xs (x `delete` ys)
                      else isValid xs ys

-- * Filter Words Matching Criteria

-- | Only include words that match these rules:
--
-- (1) must be greater than the minimum word length
-- 2. must contain mandatory character
-- 3. must contain only valid characters
-- 4. must not exceed valid character frequency
--
